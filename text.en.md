The numbers three hundred thirty-two 
=============================

The numbers three hundred thirty-two displayed on the screen in red thick letters.

Drifting
--------------

The numbers three hundred thirty-two displayed on the screen in red thick letters. They disappear when he presses Alt and Q. Three hundred of one thousand two hundred. This number should be impossible:
Like kicking yourself in the butt with a forward kick. Counterintuitive, it should not be possible.

Christoffer (an old friend) did not notice me when I looked into his room. Beside him is Andrew, who noticed me standing outside. He nods in my direction. I nod and continue in the hallway.

The very idea of having a high number like this gives me a headache. Three hundred is in the far end of the normal distribution (the median is 50).

I wander absently in the poorly lit hallway. In the side corridor D35 I see a man with a sharp mustache. I immediately get a sense of paramnesi. The mustache is thick and strong and partially covers his mouth. He is wearing a brown overcoat. Conspicuous since most have t-shirts on. He takes me aside to corridor E34. One end has collapsed, maybe 10 meters away.
\- Do you feel like participating in an experiment?
As usual, I have been drifting around in the hallways without things to do, so I answer:
\- Yes! 

He takes out a small object, it resembles a matte white button without holes in, puts it in my hands. He gives me also a transparent capsule containing some white powder.

\- Hold this. I will take you down through a meditation practice into a trance. Sit down and close your eyes!
\- Imagine that you go down an escalator. You go down deeper and deeper. Feel as you go further and further down, you feel how you relax more and more. I want that, when you feel ready, imagine that you arrive at a cozy place. Once you are there, swallow the pill and focus on a single thought:

”When the monitoring is not working”.

When I swallow my capsule I lift my eyelids for a second and watch as he swallows a similar capsule simultaneously.

Something completely different
----------------

Troublesome light stings my eyes. I feel a sudden smell of what I instinctively experience as the smell of earth. A smell I've not known before. The light is special. It has a more comfortable uniform yellowish tone. It has a different quality than the flickering fluorescent light.

The floor is not made of linoleum tiles, it's made of stone slabs. The walls are painted with colors that are not normally used. They are darker and look more natural than the usual dirt gray pastel colors. It smells of moisture, soil and water. I get an overwhelming feeling of being me in a different era.

I walk down the F-corridor toward the neighborhood committee.

On the way in I pass through the glass door that separates the housing complexes from the city center area. Normally I would need to use the id tag to enter. There are also no guards.

A surveillance camera sits above the entrance. The LED that indicates that it's on is still not lit. Either way, I can not get rid of the feeling that there is something staring at me.

When I come in, I see that there is a large table with lots of papers and books scattered on it. There are also a few items scattered across the table. On one of the books is a white cell phone. I get the feeling that it must contain the current year and what date. When I pause to pick up the phone, I'm interrupted by a primary school class led around the room. Their teacher shows them plants placed on the white shelves hung on the walls. Mainly creepers and ferns. The children stare curiously at the paper lying around.

A LED lights up red on surveillance camera in a dark corner of the otherwise by sunlit room.

When the kids leave I take the opportunity to sneak the white phone into my pocket.

Again
--------

I move away to the corridor E34. The man with the mustache is waiting for me. The linoleum floors dappled green and the pink of the woven wallpaper merge. The man looks at the white phone. Unintelligible characters and symbols fills the small 
LCD screen for each keypress. He looks blankly before my frustration. It does not seem to work.

In front of my eyes he seems to blur away into unreality and disappear.

Remaining
----

I stand in line at the meat counter. Its trays are full of different wooden details. Vegetable dishes are right on the meat counter. They have put thin pieces of wood to keep the different vegetables apart. I'm 
barefoot. The cold from the concrete floor is biting my soles. I recognize the person standing behind the counter. Without looking up, I ask him what time it is. It is an attempt to get a handle on time again.

\- Hello! My name is M..

\- Gustav

\- Do you remember the date?

\- It is April 16.

He mentions in passing.

\- It's been a good year for this?

\- No.

Behind me, a number of people, eager to get service. Above Gustav are pieces of meat wrapped in parsley and dill. Behind him hangs recently dismembered rabbits. They have built up a grill in brick masonry. Over the coals, they added one of the windows network in steel. The pieces of meat which is located in a tank at the side, in a fat marinade. The light is dim, I blink. The itch in the eyes of smoke fumes. The glow gives a special light. The air is sultry and mellow. This part of the store looks very different. It smells different. Normally you smell the cold air of freon and detergents. Silence accentuates the lack of humming from the old leaking cooling systems.

I need to think of a question I can ask to find out what year it is, without revealing myself.

There is an absence of familiar sounds?

\- No, I do not know. Not only that.

The room has a different rhythm.

I must have said some of these things out loud. Gustav laugh and show me with a flick from his wrist that I should go behind the counter. He opens a door into the warehouse. It seems hidden in the gloom. There I see cardboard boxes stacked along the walls. The walls are covered with bright 
wood paneling and has a matte skylights making the light somewhat subdued. It 
is recently built. It aesthetically pleasing in ways that to the corridors otherwise lack. It is adopted 
and reshaped by the different feelings that it inspires.

Gustav interrupts my thoughts:
\- Some of the surveillance cameras are on. They show what you're really saying. As an example if I would like to know what Grier, our shop assistant, said.

He brings up a screen, let your fingers go up and open a video stream where you see a woman with an apron behind the meat counter. The words she utters, coming from the monitor speaker, can not be understood. It sounds curtly and simple. Totally foreign and non human. It sounds as if she coughs and snorts up syllables. There are no hard consonants.

\- As you can see, one must be careful with what you do in front of these cameras.

\- Does anyone care?

\- No, no one cares why.

I shiver, hairs of my body stand up. It seems altogether bizarre.

Hold on a minute?
--------------

Fluorescent lighting flashes, flickers and varies in brightness. Like a soap bubble stretching light between dirty dark yellow and a more diluted yellow.

I'm in the corridor C21. The door to a small patio is bolted to a sheet metal fittings. As usual, when only a single pane of glass separates me from the outside, I get an intense feeling of panic. I need to grab hold of one the sofas not to cry out. There is a thin organic residue on the window. It looks like a creepy big clump of snot.

I'm startled when I realize that the door on the other side of the patio is open. I'm starting to see what the patio is used as. Someone has planted onion and potato plants. Someone has therefore wanted to prevent that the patio becomes a passage, by a latch on the door.

He's back
---------------

The man with the mustache is back. I found him in the corridor K7. The warm glow of a foam lighting illuminates his serious face. On the floor tiles around us are old pieces of cabbage leaves, flakes and fragments of plastic bags.

He stands next to a door bolted with a lock.
\- Do you know how to open it?
I enter the number three hundred sixty-two followed by a zero. 362 is the only number I can think of right now, the brain is empty also. The red LED that flashes every time I've turned into a figure, goes out and starts to turn green.

Inside the room there is a desk in wood with metal legs. Along the walls are the wide metal shelves where TV screens are lined up. I also see some different oscilloscope. The housings have a whitish hue.

There are wires and cables all over the room, becoming gordian knots here and there. The cords have a variety of thicknesses, but the colors are repeated in certain patterns: yellow, blue, red, black, and green.

Everything is turned off. At the door is a control cabinet with a lot of smaller switches. The air is bothersome dry. Beside each switch is a laminated description of its function.

I press the main power switch. The room is filled with a high-pitched and annoying sounds. It is a hypnotic humming sound. The feeling that it is too dry, spreading down into your stomach. A new sound: Metal over short intervals scraped when the ventilation fans in the far wall starts. They bring a racket to sound the carpet in the room.

\- What is this?

\- There is some kind of loop. If you look at how the graphics are structured, you can see that it illustrates one iteration of shafts with generation numbers 8, 21 and 512.

Numbers like waves across the screen

\- What do you think this is?

\- Could it be the date we're looking for?

\- Doesn't feel like it.

I relax and let your eyes unfocused see the screen in the dusk.

Somewhere else completely
---------------------

I feel the smell of pine and'm in a pleasant shade. The water ripples light blue, like bleached by the sun. Down the beach is stone slabs barely covered by sand.

My head aches and feels warm, like after a short nap in the sun.
